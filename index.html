    <h2>About Me</h2> <!-- about me and my interests -->
    <p>I am a student in learning web development which is a whole new subject for me. I'm very excited and looking forward to gaining expertise to have fun and be creative with this new skill.</p>

    <p>I'm interested most sports but basketball would be my favorite, although I don't get to play much anymore. I currently practice kendo and is open to trying all sorts of physical activities.</p>
